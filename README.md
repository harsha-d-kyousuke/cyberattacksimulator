A sleek, web-based tool to **simulate common cyber attacks** (XSS, SQL Injection, Brute Force) on deliberately vulnerable applications.  
⚠️ **Educational Use Only** — not for real-world exploitation.

## 🚀 Features

- **Attack Scenarios**
  - Cross-Site Scripting (**XSS**)
  - SQL Injection
  - Brute Force (rate-limiting test)

- **Simulation Dashboard**
  - Choose attack type & target URL
  - Optional custom payloads
  - Detailed vulnerability reports

- **AI-Generated Fixes**
  - Human-readable recommendations for each vulnerability  
  - Examples: input sanitization, parameterized queries, rate limiting

- **UI Highlights**
  - Built with **TailwindCSS**
  - Responsive two-panel layout
  - Custom modal alerts (no `window.alert`)

## 🔧 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cyber-attack-simulator.git
   cd cyber-attack-simulator
Open index.html in your browser.
(No backend setup required for this version.)

Fill in:

Attack type

Target URL (e.g., https://example.com/vulnerable-app)

Optional custom payload

Click Run Simulation → View report panel.

📊 Example Payloads
XSS: <script>alert('XSS')</script>

SQL Injection: ' OR 1=1 --

Brute Force: Try with weak credentials (simulation only)

📖 Roadmap
 Add CSRF, Directory Traversal, File Upload attack modules

 Export PDF vulnerability reports

 Backend API with FastAPI/Flask

 Integrated AI chatbot assistant
